# Discovery of the Nearly Zero Flux between Two Parallel Conductors in Planar Transformers

## I. INTRODUCTION
最重要的背景是高频下变压器的导体并联 
研究：FEA肯定准，但是物理意义不明确，没法指导设计。其他的办法都非常复杂

## II. PARALLEL CURRENT DISTRIBUTION PRINCIPLE

### A. Theoretical support for the cancelled flux between two parallel conductors
Fig.2 Two transformers (a) non-interleaved and (b) interleaved examples
illustrating the proximity effect in parallel conductors. Conductor P carries ip(t).
Conductors S1 and S2 are connected in parallel. Simulated H filed at 5MHz in
insulation layers for (c) non-interleaved and (d) interleaved windings. The
copper thickness is 105μm and the spacing is 100μm for each layer



### B. Proposed approach to predict parallel current distributions
Fig.3 Investigation over the effect of the insulation thickness on parallel current distribution. (a) Case I has identical insulation thickness th for each layer. (b)
Case II has different insulation thicknesses. Current distributions as a function of frequency from 10kHz to 1GHz are measured for (c) Case I and (d) Case II.
From 10kHz to 100kHz, parallel currents I1 and I2 are measured every 10kHz. From 100kHz to 1MHz, they are measured every 50kHz. From 1MHz to 10MHz,
the scale is 1MHz. From 10 MHz to 100MHz, the scale changes to 10MHz. From 100MHz to 1GHz, the sample scale is 100MHz. (e) I1 and I2 versus insulation
ratio tt/tb with tt+tb=0.6mm at 1 MHz
