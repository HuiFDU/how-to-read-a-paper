Fig. 2: Transformation of Litz wire of 𝑛s circular strands into rectangular strands and rearranged into an √𝑛s by √𝑛s matrix to apply Dowell’s approach.


### Ferreira’s approach:

internal magnetic field 𝐻i generated by the strands. [39]

### Litz loss modelling with 1-D approaches:
Fig. 4: Different Litz wire strand distribution modelling approaches: a) radial layers used in [39], b) square packing used in [47], c) triangular packing used in [44],
and d) best-known circles in circle with random rotation (this work).

My comments:
Very solid work. but I have not yet fully understand the equations. 
I personally just cannot understand the well-know Dowell's approach and Ferreira's approach.
