## Abstract
This paper presents a magnetic-free ultra-thin 24 V-to-1 V 120 A linear-extendable group-operated point-of-load (LEGO-POL) voltage regulation module (VRM) with air-coupled inductors (Air-LEGO). The thickness of the Air-LEGO converter is very low (about 3 mm), facilitating compact packaging, relaxed thermal constraints, and magnetic-free integration. The module operates by initially stepping down the 24 V input voltage using three series-stacked 2:1 switched-capacitor submodules, resulting in an average voltage of 4 V on the virtual intermediate buses. This virtual bus voltage is then further stepped down to below 1 V through three two-phase buck submodules. Each of these six phases is capable of delivering a peak current of 20 A and regulating the output voltage. Buck submodules are implemented with air-coupled inductors, where designs based on both PCB and Litz-wire windings are explored and compared. Experimental results highlight the viability and potential of incorporating air-coupled inductors into VRM designs, while also addressing associated drawbacks and essential design considerations.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Rapid advancement of high-performance computing systems, such as CPUs and GPUs, has significantly amplified the demand for compact, efficient, and reliable power delivery solutions. These technological strides necessitate voltage regulation modules (VRMs) that can handle higher currents and ensure stable power delivery within the constrained spaces of modern electronic devices, as depicted in *Fig. 1*. As CPUs and GPUs continue to grow in computational power, their associated power consumption scales accordingly, creating a substantial challenge for VRMs to deliver adequate power without compromising critical factors such as spatial efficiency, energy efficiency, and signal integrity [1], [2].

Typically, VRMs have relied on magnetic core-based inductors to meet the requirements for voltage regulation and current handling capabilities. While these inductors have proven effective, they come with inherent limitations, including core losses, thermal dissipation requirements, and substantial volume, all of which constrain the overall efficiency and miniaturization potential of VRMs [3], [4]. Additionally, the need for a magnetic core also hinders high density integration, advanced packaging, and effective thermal management [5]–[9]. Converters utilizing magnetic core inductors often face challenges due to the temperature sensitivity of the core materials. Unlike semiconductor devices, which can typically withstand higher operating temperatures (up to a few hundred °C), magnetic cores are much more temperature-sensitive (less than 100°C). Key parameters such as permeability and core losses can vary substantially with temperature changes [10], and the performance of magnetic cores may degrade or even fail under elevated temperatures. These thermal limitations impose constraints on the integration, reliability, and optimization of VRM designs.

In contrast, air-core inductors eliminate these temperature-related dependencies entirely. Without the need for magnetic materials, air-core designs offer greater thermal resilience, expanding the design space and enhancing the adaptability of converters to various thermal environments. This freedom not only relaxes the temperature constraints of magnetic cores but also enables more robust and optimized VRM architectures, providing improved scalability and performance for modern high-power applications. Without saturation, core loss, and frequency limit, air-core magnetics can be pushed to operate at very high frequencies while maintaining high system performance [11], [12]. Multi-phase air-core magnetics, e.g., the origami inductors developed in [13], can benefit from multiphase coupling for flux cancellation, ripple reduction, and improved transient [14].

This paper systematically investigates the potential of using air-coupled inductors in ultra-thin VRM designs, which bypasses the limitations imposed by magnetic cores. The proposed Air-LEGO converter leverages air-coupled inductors to achieve a low profile of just 3 mm. Air-core inductors offer promising opportunity in the MHz frequency range [11]. The two-phase or multiphase coupling of these inductors fundamentally further reduce the energy storage needed in the inductors, ensuring a fast dynamic response [13], [14].

Key contributions of this paper include analysis, simulation, and experimental validation of the Air-LEGO architecture, with a focus on demonstrating the feasibility, benefits, and challenges associated with air-coupled inductor-based VRMs in high step-down applications. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the circuit topology and operation principles of Air-LEGO architecture; Section III demonstrates the design consideration and simulation results of air-coupled inductors; Section IV presents the experimental results of the Air-LEGO prototype, highlighting the feasibility and associated drawbacks of using air-coupled inductors. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.

## II. LEGO ARCHITECTURE AND OPERATION PRINCIPLES

The Air-LEGO VRM design builds upon the Linear-Extendable Group Operated (LEGO) architecture [5], [6], as illustrated in *Fig. 2*. The LEGO architecture features a series-input and parallel-output configuration, making it particularly well-suited for high-current power delivery applications that require large voltage conversion ratios. The LEGO architecture includes two primary building blocks: an initial step-down stage employing series-stacked 2:1 switched-capacitor (SC) units and a secondary step-down stage utilizing multi-phase buck units, together with multi-phase coupled inductors.

In the first stage of this Air-LEGO design, an input voltage of 24 V is stepped down to three intermediate bus voltages of 4 V each using a set of three series-stacked 2:1 switched-capacitor submodules. This series-stacked arrangement not only ensures balanced voltage distribution across all submodules but also minimizes voltage stress on individual components, thereby enhancing reliability and enabling the use of lower-voltage-rated devices.

The second stage further converts the intermediate bus voltage of 4 V to the target output voltage, such as 1 V, using three multi-phase buck converter submodules. Each submodule features two interleaved phases, operating at a duty cycle of approximately 25%, which significantly improves current-handling capability while effectively reducing output voltage ripple. The interleaved operation helps distribute thermal dissipation and reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI), contributing to the overall system's efficiency and reliability. In this design, each phase is capable of delivering up to 20 A, culminating in a total output current capacity of 120 A.

Moreover, the modular nature of the LEGO architecture allows for easy customization and scalability, which is critical for addressing the diverse power demands of modern computing systems. Additional series-stacked or parallel submodules can be incorporated to accommodate varying voltage conversion ratios or to support even higher current demands.

*Fig. 3* depicts the switching strategy of LEGO architecture. The 2:1 switched-capacitor unit operates with fixed complementary 50% duty ratio gate signals (Φ1 and Φ2) at a relatively low switching frequency (i.e., a few hundred kHz). This low-frequency operation reduces switching losses, enhancing overall efficiency. Meanwhile, the buck stage utilizes interleaved high-frequency operation, which reduces output current ripple and provides a high control bandwidth for fast transient and precise regulation.

A unique feature of this architecture is the functional integration of the two stages. Without the need for a resonant inductor in the switched-capacitor stage or a large dc decoupling capacitor between the stages, the switched-capacitor and buck units are inherently merged. The buck units act as controlled current sources to soft-charge the switched capacitors. The capacitors in the switched-capacitor units are continuously charged and discharged by the current sourced from the buck stage. Furthermore, by coordinating the switching sequences, the buck inductor currents only flow through the switched-capacitor units when the high-side buck switches are active. This enables zero-current switching (ZCS) in the switched-capacitor units by aligning their switching transitions with the free-wheeling state of the buck units, significantly reducing switching losses.

The LEGO architecture also incorporates mechanisms to ensure automatic current balancing among phases. Current balancing is achieved by properly coordinating the switching frequencies of the switched-capacitor and buck stages. Since the absence of a large dc decoupling capacitor leads to higher ripple in the virtual intermediate bus voltages, there is potential for phase current mismatch in the buck units. To address this, a passive phase rotation scheme [5] is implemented. When the buck switching frequency is chosen as:
`fBuck = (2k+1) · fsc, k = 1, 2, 3...` (1)
where `fBuck` and `fsc` are the switching frequencies of the buck stage and switched-capacitor stage, respectively, an odd number of buck switching events (e.g., five, as shown in *Fig. 3*) occurs within one switching cycle of the switched-capacitor stage. This odd-switching frequency alignment causes the buck phases to rotate through different switch positions, with each phase taking its turn to experience the highest virtual bus voltage ripple. This ensures balanced average input voltages across all buck switches and effectively mitigates phase current mismatches, resulting in uniform current distribution across the entire system.

LEGO architecture provides large voltage conversion ratio and high current capacity with reduced switch stress for high current VRM applications.*
*Fig. 3. Theoretical gate drive modulation strategy of LEGO architecture. The switched-capacitor unit is driven by low frequency 50% duty ratio square waves with 180° phase difference. The two-phase buck unit is driven by a higher frequency sequence with desired duty ratio, where two phases are 180° interleaved. Soft-charging of capacitors, zero-current switching of SC unit, and phase current balancing through phase rotation are achieved.*

## III. AIR-COUPLED INDUCTOR DESIGN

The design of air-coupled inductors for the Air-LEGO converter requires optimization of the inductor winding geometry to balance self-inductance, mutual inductance, and winding resistance. *Fig. 4* depicts the fundamental geometry of the 2-phase air-coupled inductor with 2 turns each phase, focusing on three critical dimensions: l1, l2, and l3. These dimensions directly impact the electromagnetic properties of the inductor. The overlap region defined by l2 × l3 plays a key role in determining the coupling factor between the two phases. A higher coupling factor enhances energy transfer and ripple cancellation but may increase parasitic effects. Conversely, the l1 portion, which remains largely uncoupled, provides additional self-inductance, offering an extra degree of freedom to determine the characteristics of the inductor. The dimension l3 is largely constrained by the physical footprint of the power devices and cannot be significantly adjusted without affecting the overall layout of the VRM. This makes the proper selection of l1 and l2 critical to achieving an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency. A comprehensive parameter sweep simulation was conducted, evaluating the interplay between self-inductance, mutual inductance, and winding resistance under various configurations. *Fig. 5* presents the simulation results for different combinations of l1 and l2.

Based on the simulation results, l1 was set to 12 mm and l2 to 8 mm, values that offer a balanced design capable of meeting the desired system performance metrics. This configuration ensures adequate self-inductance, sufficient coupling, and reasonable winding resistance.

For PCB winding implementations, interleaving is a critical technique to mitigate losses caused by the skin effect and proximity effect, which are especially pronounced at high switching frequencies [15]. *Fig. 6* illustrates the simulated current distributions for examples of interleaved and non-interleaved structures in an 8-layer PCB stack, highlighting the impact of interleaving on reducing ac resistance (Rac). In the non-interleaved structure, the skin effect and proximity effect lead to uneven current distribution across the conductor, resulting in a simulated Rac that is 2.25 times higher than in the interleaved design. Layer interleaving ensures that current flows more uniformly, reducing resistive losses and improving the efficiency of the inductor.

Additionally, interleaving minimizes the effects of fringing flux. A common concern with air-core designs is the associated electromagnetic interference (EMI). There is potentially high-frequency stray magnetic fields dispersing into the surrounding space, interfering with the operation of nearby devices. However, interleaving provides an effective solution to this issue. As shown in *Fig. 7*, interleaving significantly reduces fringing flux by arranging the windings so that opposing magnetic fields largely cancel each other. This cancellation ensures that the majority of the flux remains confined near the plane of the windings, mitigating the potential EMI risks, improving the signal integrity, and greatly enhancing the compatibility of the air-core inductors with other devices in densely packed systems. This capability is particularly important in compact VRM designs, where maintaining electromagnetic compatibility is critical for ensuring stable and reliable operation. Through proper interleaving, the air-coupled inductors achieve desired performance without compromising the system's EMI characteristics. Additional shielding sheets can be attached to the air-coupled inductor to further mitigate the EMI.

*Fig. 8* presents the selected interleaving structure, where each phase comprises two parallel winding sets, and the two phases are fully interleaved to optimize performance. This structure helps to reduce both dc and ac resistance, and mitigates the EMI as aforementioned. The impact of parasitic capacitance caused by this fully interleaved structure is not obviously observed in the experiment.

For Litz wire implementations, a similar geometric configuration and size are adopted to match the PCB windings, ensuring similar electromagnetic characteristics. The wire gauge of the Litz wire is selected to closely match the total thickness of the PCB windings, allowing for a comparable low-profile design while retaining the advantages of reduced ac resistance. To maintain uniform parameters and achieve effective coupling, a bobbin and frame are specifically designed for the Litz wire inductors. These components ensure the windings remain tightly packed and precisely aligned, optimizing their electromagnetic properties.

*Fig. 9* showcases the completed inductors for both PCB and Litz wire implementations. The PCB-winding inductors are implemented with two 8-layer PCBs in parallel, where the copper thickness is 1 oz each and the total thickness is 2.1 mm. The Litz-wire inductors are implemented with Litz wires consisting of 300 strands of 46 AWG wires, resulting in a similar total thickness of 2.1 mm after being pressed. *TABLE I* provides a comparative analysis of their key performance metrics. The results indicate that while PCB windings offer superior integration, easier manufacturing, and lower profile, Litz wire inductors demonstrate slightly better efficiency at higher frequencies due to their inherent ability to mitigate the skin effect more effectively. Overall, the choice between PCB and Litz wire implementations depends on the specific application requirements. PCB windings are preferable for compact, high-density designs where integration is paramount, while Litz wire inductors are better suited for scenarios requiring maximum efficiency at ultra-high frequencies. Both approaches underscore the importance of optimizing winding design to achieve the best trade-offs between efficiency, EMI, and manufacturability in modern VRM systems.

## IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

To validate the strengths and performance of the Air-LEGO converter, a fully operational prototype was constructed and thoroughly tested. The floating switches in the switched-capacitor (SC) stage are implemented using Onsemi NTTFD2D8N03P1E dual-channel MOSFETs. These switches are driven by Infineon 2EDF7275K isolated gate drivers, and a TI UCC27212 charge pump is employed for bootstrapping, providing the necessary gate drive voltage for the floating switches. The remaining switches in the SC stage are implemented with Onsemi FDMF3039 DrMOS devices, chosen for their integrated design and high efficiency. All switches in the buck stage utilize Infineon TDA21490 DrMOS modules, which are optimized for high switching frequencies and low conduction losses. The switching frequencies of the SC-stage and the buck stage are 400 kHz and 2 MHz, respectively.

*Fig. 10* provides a photograph of the prototype featuring PCB-winding inductors. The image highlights the compact integration of the air-coupled inductors, which significantly contribute to the converter's ultra-thin profile. The air-core design not only eliminates the thermal constraints associated with magnetic cores but also enables a high degree of design flexibility. The overall prototype demonstrates the feasibility of combining air-coupled inductors with the LEGO architecture to achieve a low-profile VRM design. Notably, a second prototype was also constructed using aforementioned Litz-wire inductors, while keeping the rest of the design identical. The interfaces of the Litz wire-based inductors are fully compatible with the PCB-winding version, ensuring consistency in testing and performance comparison.

A series of tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the prototype. *Fig. 11* presents the testing platform, which includes a dc power supply, an electronic load, digital multimeters with current shunts for accurate power measurement, and an oscilloscope for signal monitoring. During the tests, the Air-LEGO prototype was cooled using a single dc fan without the addition of a heat sink, demonstrating its inherent thermal efficiency. In fact, the low-profile and compact design of the Air-LEGO converter, enabled by the flat air-coupled inductor structure, offers significant advantages for thermal management. This thin geometry makes it exceptionally easy to integrate a heat sink directly onto the system, providing effective cooling for both the semiconductor devices and the inductors. The potential to combine heat dissipation for these components further simplifies the overall thermal management and ensures enhanced system reliability, especially under high-power operating conditions.

Key experimental waveforms are shown in *Fig. 12*, illustrating the switching behavior and the typical operation of the Air-LEGO prototype. *Fig. 13* provides a thermal image of the Air-LEGO prototype with PCB windings while delivering a full load output current of 120 A at a 1 V output voltage. In this case, the hottest components are the buck stage switches, which handle the majority of the power dissipation.

To evaluate the performance of the Air-LEGO prototype under various operating conditions, efficiency tests were conducted across different input voltages and buck stage switching frequencies. *Fig. 14* presents the experimentally measured efficiency curves, highlighting the system's behavior under these varying conditions.

Efficiency measurements highlight the differences between the PCB winding and Litz wire winding implementations. With 24 V input voltage, the prototype with PCB windings achieved a peak efficiency of 75.8%, while the Litz wire windings demonstrated a significantly higher peak efficiency of 85.9%, benefiting from reduced ac resistance due to the optimized wire geometry. At full load, the efficiencies were 73.1% and 62.5%, respectively. More specifically, the efficiency test results reveal several valuable insights and conclusions worth discussing in detail:

*   **Different air-coupled inductor implementations:** Efficiency test results consistently show that Litz-wire inductors achieve noticeably higher efficiency compared to PCB-winding inductors. This efficiency advantage is primarily attributed to differences in resistive losses within the windings. As shown in *TABLE I*, Litz wire inductors exhibit significantly lower dc and ac resistance despite having nearly identical geometric dimensions to their PCB winding counterparts. The key reason for this difference lies in the limitations of the PCB-based design. With the overall thickness constrained, the copper layers in PCB windings are inherently thin, resulting in much higher winding resistance, particularly in terms of dc resistance. Additionally, Litz wire inductors offer superior mitigation of skin effect and proximity effect, which are significant at the operating frequencies of the Air-LEGO converter. This advantage enables Litz wire to achieve lower ac resistance as well, further reducing the resistive loss. On the other hand, the trade-off between the two implementation methods lies in their manufacturability and consistency. PCB windings are better suited for standardized production processes, offering excellent uniformity and repeatability in manufacturing. In contrast, Litz wire inductors, which rely on manual or semi-automated winding processes, are more challenging to produce with the same level of consistency, making scalability more difficult. Additionally, differences in the inductance values between the two types of inductors also contribute to variations in the overall efficiency of the converter. However, this impact is relatively minor compared to the influence of resistive losses.
*   **Different buck stage switching frequencies:** The switching frequency of the buck stage significantly affects the efficiency of the converter, primarily because it operates in a hard-switching mode. Typically, lower switching frequencies are preferred to reduce switching losses and improve efficiency. However, in the test of Air-LEGO prototype, it was observed that operating at 1.2 MHz did not result in higher efficiency as expected; instead, it led to a measurable decrease in efficiency compared to the 2 MHz case. This is mostly due to the use of air-coupled inductors. Unlike conventional magnetic-core inductors, air-core inductors provide significantly lower inductance values. Consequently, the circuit experiences much larger current ripple, which is highly sensitive to switching frequency. At 1.2 MHz, the reduction in switching losses achieved by lowering the frequency is outweighed by the increase in resistive losses caused by the larger current ripple. This increased ripple not only amplifies conduction losses in the inductor windings but also impacts other components, such as switches and capacitors, leading to an overall decrease in efficiency. These findings align with the general understanding that air-core inductors are better suited for operation at relatively high switching frequencies. At higher frequencies, conventional magnetic-core inductors often suffer from substantial core losses, whereas air-core inductors maintain high efficiency. Additionally, higher frequencies help reduce current ripple, thereby improving overall performance. The tests also showed that at 1.2 MHz, there was a slight efficiency improvement under light-load conditions. In such scenarios, overall losses are dominated by switching losses rather than conduction losses, making the reduction in switching frequency beneficial.
*   **Different input voltages:** Generally, larger voltage conversion ratios lead to lower efficiency, and our test results broadly align with this observation. Higher input voltages increase the switching losses in both the SC stage and the buck stage, while also increasing voltage ripple across the capacitors in the SC stage, further contributing to higher losses. In the current prototype, the switching devices in both the SC stage and the buck stage were initially selected for a 48 V input voltage. However, achieving a 48 V to 1 V conversion requires the buck stage to operate with an extremely low duty ratio, such as 12.5%. This significantly amplifies current ripple, resulting in excessive conduction and ripple-related losses. As a result, the rated input voltage for the prototype was ultimately set to 24 V or 18 V to balance performance and efficiency. Despite this adjustment, the overrating of the switching devices for lower voltages introduces additional inefficiencies. The higher RDS(on) and Coss of the selected devices, due to the higher voltage rating, lead to increased conduction and switching losses, respectively. These factors lead to the overall low efficiency observed in the Air-LEGO prototype, particularly under full-load conditions. An interesting behavior was observed when the input voltage was set to 18 V. As the load current increases, the efficiency at 18 V begins to decline significantly. This is primarily due to the need for a progressively higher duty ratio to maintain a constant output voltage. At higher duty ratios, the SC stage loses the Zero-Current Switching (ZCS) condition depicted in *Fig. 3*, and transitions into hard-switching operation. This change drastically increases switching losses, causing a noticeable drop in overall efficiency.

Moreover, the loss breakdown is calculated for the Air-LEGO prototype under the conditions of a 24 V input voltage and a 2 MHz buck stage switching frequency, as shown in *Fig. 15*. The results reveal that the buck stage DrMOS devices contribute the largest portion of the total power loss, consistent with the observations from the thermal image in *Fig. 13*. The primary sources of these losses are the RDS(on) and Coss characteristics of the over-rated devices, as well as the high switching frequency.

The winding resistive losses of the air-coupled inductors also account for a significant portion of the total losses. These losses are driven by the relatively small inductance values of the air-core inductors, which, combined with the small duty ratio, result in large current ripples. Additionally, the inherent large dc and ac resistances of the air-core inductors also contribute substantially to the overall loss.

Another observation is the increase in SC stage losses beyond approximately 60 A of output current. As the duty ratio increases, the SC stage loses its soft-switching (ZCS) conditions, transitioning into hard-switching operation. This shift introduces additional switching losses, further reducing efficiency at higher load currents.

These insights provide valuable guidance for the design of the next version of Air-LEGO prototype. Key improvements include the better selection of switching devices optimized for the operating frequencies, rated voltages, and currents of the converter. Additionally, the air-core inductor design needs further optimization to increase the inductance value while minimizing both dc and ac resistances, all while maintaining the desired low-profile and thin form factor. These refinements are critical for achieving better efficiency and overall performance in future iterations.

## V. CONCLUSIONS

This paper demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating air-coupled inductors into the VRM design, enabling ultra-low-profile and compact integration. By eliminating the use of magnetic cores, the design removes the temperature limitations associated with magnetic materials, significantly expanding the possibilities for VRM integration and simplifying thermal management. The absence of core losses also allows for more efficient cooling strategies, making the Air-LEGO architecture highly adaptable to advanced power delivery requirements.

Through comparative experiments, Litz wire windings were shown to outperform PCB windings, achieving superior efficiency due to their lower ac and dc resistance at the selected buck-stage switching frequency of 2 MHz and the designed geometry. Furthermore, proper interleaving of the windings not only helps to reduce ac winding losses but also effectively addresses EMI concerns by confining magnetic flux and minimizing stray fields. These improvements highlight the necessity of careful winding design in optimizing air-core inductor performance.

However, the prototype revealed some efficiency limitations. Both the SC stage and the buck stage experienced significant losses in their switching devices, and additional losses arose from the winding resistance of the air-coupled inductors. These losses underscore one of the inherent challenges of air-core inductor-based VRMs, where the trade-off between efficiency and compactness must be carefully managed.
